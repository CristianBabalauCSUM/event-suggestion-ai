# Event Scheduler with AI Integration (React Native + Python)

## Project Overview

This project is part of an Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) assignment, integrating a React Native + Expo frontend with a Python backend using the Ollama 3.1 model. The application helps users schedule events on a calendar. Users can manually input events or, by leveraging AI, get smart suggestions for activities and events based on their preferences.
