# Welcome to our Event-Suggestion App ðŸ‘‹

This project was created as a project for the Inteligent User Interface Course at the UM BCS. <br>
The main purpouse of the application is to create a local area event suggester, that will consider a lot of factors before giving you a <b>  matched event </b>, such as:
<ul>
   <li> Your free time slots, analyzed from the calendar app </li>
   <li> Hobby Analyzers </li>
   <li> Mood questionnaire  </li>
   <li> Distance to the event </li>
</ul>

<br> 

Moreover, our application comes with offers on how to spend user's time in case there is no public event incoming. It can suggest user a variety of actions, inspired by his own personality.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
